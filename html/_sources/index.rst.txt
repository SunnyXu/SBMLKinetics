SBMLKinetics is a Python package to evaluate and classify kinetics in SBML models. 
There are many possible kinetics like the zeroth order, mass action, Michaelis-Menten, 
Hill kinetics and others. This work characterizes the kinetics in the BioModels 
Database as an example to improve modeling best practices. Our tool can analyze any data sets 
with SBML files as input. Users can also use this tool to compare different data sets. For 
instance, we compare the distribution of kinetics for the signaling and metabolic networks and 
find the substantial differences between two types of networks. If you are using any of the 
code, please cite the article (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-023-05380-3) and 
the PYPI web page (https://pypi.org/project/SBMLKinetics/).
